## Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to read my first blog post. Woooo!

I'm Victor Gonçalves. This year, I graduated from Harvard with both a Bachelor's and a concurrent Master's in Computer Science—all under a full scholarship. I learned a ton! Through internships in San Francisco and New York City, countless projects, and even learning how to read research papers for the first time.

However, after a four-year sprint, I felt incredibly burnt out. For my mental health, I decided to take a break instead of moving to NYC to start a job on Wall Street. Try explaining to Latino immigrant parents that you want to quit your job on Wall Street...

During my final semester, I developed a strong interest in entrepreneurship. I conducted extensive market research and worked on a personal venture at the Harvard Innovation Labs. Additionally, I continued exploring potential products at home, though I admit that believing I could launch a company with my skills at the time was a little naive.

Around that time, I joined **Health Harbor** as a founding engineer. I was quickly humbled by what it takes to start a tech company and what it means to write agile code. I failed... a LOT. But with time, things got better. I embraced the concept of *failing fast* and became a *hypothesis-based engineer*, coding experiments rapidly. Amidst the challenging new grad hiring season, I found peace in the rush and uncertainty of AI—and navigated lots of mistranscriptions in voice-to-text models and LLM failure cases.

## What the Future Brings for `victorgoncalves.com`

I want to use this website as an exciting way to track my progress on various projects while maintaining clear documentation on how I did it all. This is for two reasons:

1. **Personal Reflection**: To have a single place to look back and track my journey as a software engineer. Like an in-between of the memories of Instagram, but more readable than Github.
2. **Communication**: At the foundations of my career is my belief towards excellent communication. As a software engineer, this comes with writing clean code, and excellent documentation. I want to use my projects as practice of writing readable things.

### Projects

Additionally, I definitely want to use this website to document to learn and experiment with different tech stacks and turn them into fully-fledged projects. Some ideas on what to work on next are:

- Building a home server with Proxmox and setting up different containers/VMs.
- Starting a Kubernetes project.
- Diving into Redis!

### Hobbies & Passions
I think it would be really cool to expand my hobbies into the website and create interactive portfolios for my various hobbies. Some examples would be:

- **Photography**: I became really into photography during my freshman year of college, and took some really amazing shots over the past 4 years! In order to focus on school, I took some time off, but I might get back into it.

*Another photo in Bolivia at the Salar de Uyuni!*

- **Music**: I own ~100 vinyls and I just keep them in my room. I think it would be cool to have a way to look through my library online.
- **Reading List**: I might keep track of all the books I want to read, along with summaries and learnings year-to-year. Was inspired by [anantjain.dev](https://anantjain.dev "Anant Jain's Personal Website").
- **Personal Stories**: I have a lot of stories of what it is like to grow up in the states as a Brazilian immigrant. Might get around to telling my story sometime. :)

Overall, super excited for the future of this thing. I am inspired to build some really cool things. Stay tuned! :)
