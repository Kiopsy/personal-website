## Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to read my first blog post. Woooo!

A little about myself at this point in my career: My name is Victor Gon√ßalves. This year, I graduated from Harvard with my Bachelor's and concurrent Master's in Computer Science. Under a full scholarship, I decided to push for my Master's degree. Aside from different internships in SF and NYC, I learned a ton from completing a bunch of projects, and even learned how to read a research paper for the first time!

After finishing school, I felt incredibly burnt out from the 4-year long sprint. I took a break for my mental health, and instead of moving to NYC, I decided to stay at home. Try explaining to latino immigrant parents that you wanted to quit your job on Wall Street...

However, during my last semester, I became deeply interested in entrepreneurship. I conducted extensive market research and worked on a personal venture at the Harvard Innovation Labs. At home I continued my research on many potential products. Around that time, I joined **Health Harbor** as a founding engineer. I  was quickly humbled when I learned about what it takes to start a tech company and what it means to write agile code. I failed... a LOT. With time, it got better. I embraced the concept of *failing fast* and became a *hypothesis-based engineer*, coding experiments rapidly. Amidst the challenging new grad hiring season, I found peace in the rush and uncertainty of AI. (and a lot of mistranscriptions in voice-to-text models and LLM failure cases).

At this point in my career, I'd consider myself a generalist, having touched so many tech stacks. While I plan to delve deeper into a few areas, infrastructure and distributed systems currently have my eye!

I finally set up a personal website! I wanted a central place to share new ideas and projects, documenting my journey as a software engineer. I've been meaning to start one of these for a while... so here we go!

## What the Future Brings for `victorgoncalves.com`

I want to use this website as an exciting way to track my progress on various projects while maintaining clear documentation on how I did it all. This is for two reasons:

1. **Personal Reflection**: To have a single place to look back and track my journey as a software engineer.
2. **Communication Skills**: One of my overall career goals is to be an excellent communicator. As a software engineer, this is crucial in many ways.

But there's more! I also want to delve into other passions of mine.

### Expanding My Hobbies into the Website

- **Photography**: I plan to showcase the photos I'm really proud of and create an interactive portfolio for these cool shots.

- **Music**: I might even consider making an interactive showcase for my vinyl collection!

### Exploring New Tech Stacks

I definitely want to learn and experiment with different tech stacks and turn them into fully-fledged projects. I have a whole list! I aim to document the process for each project to maybe help others along the way. Next on my list are:

- Building a home server with Proxmox and setting up different containers/VMs.
- Starting a Kubernetes project.
- Diving into Redis!

### Sharing More Personal Stories

- **Reading List**: I might keep track of all the books I want to read, along with summaries and learnings from each one.
- **Immigrant Journey**: I might share stories from my experiences as a Brazilian immigrant in the U.S.

I am really excited about all the possibilities! Stay tuned as you watch me figure out my career. :)
