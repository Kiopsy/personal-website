    title: "Secure QR Codes (SQR)",
    date: "April 2024 - May 2024",
    description:
      "Developed Secure QR (SQR) codes to address security vulnerabilities in traditional QR codes, \
       which are prone to QR phishing (quishing) and unauthorized access. Implemented digital signatures \
       and a third-party certification authority to enhance security while maintaining standard compatibility. \
       Used ECDSA for authentication and integrity validation. \
       Each SQR code embeds a URL and its entity's public key, making any content alterations detectable.",

    description:
      "Developed a graph neural network (GNN)-based cost model to predict runtime of tensor computation graphs on the \
       TPUGraphs dataset for a Kaggle competition. Enhanced the baseline GNN with attention layers and introduced \
       runtime violation ratios to address GPU memory constraints when loading graphs into memory. Achieved a 1.25x \
       improvement in validation OPA score over the baseline. Used the Harvard research compute cluster for large-scale training.",

       institution, broker, and client components. Implemented using gRPC for connections and Paxos \
       for distributed consensus and orderbook replication across exchange servers. Established automatic \
       reconnections between broker/institution and the exchange. Flask and HTML frontend UI. \
       Conducted experiments using trading bots with various strategies to test speed (latency/throughput) \
       and reliability of the system.",
