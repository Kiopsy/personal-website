Thanks to @lithafnium (steve-li.com) for inspiration and a solid starting point. I expanded on their project with:

- Blog Tab: A space for sharing thoughts and tutorials.
- Markdown to React Converter: Dynamically turns Markdown files into React pages. Planning to use this for project docs & blog posts.
- Code Cleanup: Simplified the codebase for easier updates and maintenance.

Excited to modify the style and make it my own in the coming months. Just wanted to get something out there for a 1st iteration.
